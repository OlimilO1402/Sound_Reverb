# Sound_Reverb
## Testing different reverb algorithms from old code in C an C++  

a little testing project for two elderly but simple yet comprehendible and reproducible implementations of 
reverb algorithms. on the basis of a bunch of kamm filters and all-pass-filters.
contains the source code of 
 * GVerb (in C) von Juhana Sadeharju (1999) und 
 * FreeVerb (in C++) von Jezar at Dreampoint (2000) 
as comments in the Code above each function. 
The code is converted to VB, togehter with a few Links to useful internet pages with concise explanations 
of the reverb thematic. Attention echo und reverb are generally known as the same thing, but it's not.
The musik industry considers them as different "effects".
Echo(aka delay) is way more simpler to implement as reverb. This is not about echo(delay) but reverb.
Project started in sept 2015.
