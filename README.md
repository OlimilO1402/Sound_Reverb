# Sound_Reverb
## Testing different reverb algorithms from old code in C an C++  

a little testing project for two elderly but simple yet comprehendible and reproducible implementations of 
reverb algorithms. on the basis of a bunch of comb-filters and all-pass-filters.
contains the source code of ...
 * GVerb (in C) by Juhana Sadeharju (1999) und 
 * FreeVerb (in C++) by Jezar at Dreampoint (2000) 
...as comments in the code above each function. 
The code is converted to VB. also you can find some links to useful internet pages with concise explanations 
of the reverb thematic. Please pay attention to the following echo und reverb are generally known as the 
same thing because in nature one can not exist without the other, but in fact it's not the same.
Music industry considers them as different "effects".
Echo(aka delay) is way more simpler to implement as reverb. This is not about echo(delay) but reverb.
Project started in sept 2015.
